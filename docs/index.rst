Infineon XMC4700 Relax Kit
==========================

Infineon XMC4700/4800 Relax Kit is equipped with the ARM Cortex-M4 based
XMC4700 microcontroller (MCU) from Infineon Technologies. These kits are
designed to evaluate the capabilities of the XMC4700 MCU. The Relax Kits
feature an Ethernet-enabled communication option.

Flash Layout
************

The internal flash of the XMC4700 module is organized in a single flash area
with 16 sectors. The flash starts at address 0xC000000.

.. note:: If flash memory must be used in a Zerynth program, it is recommended
   to begin using it from secure addresses towards the end the bytecode (start
   address of the bytecode can be found in the log console of Zerynth Studio
   during the uplink operation), leaving a minimum safe place to minimize the
   chance of clashes.

Connect, Register, Virtualize and Program
*****************************************

The Infineon XMC4700 comes with a usb debugger chip on board that allows
programming and opening the UART of the module.
**Drivers are needed** (Linux, Mac or Windows) and can be downloaded from the official
`JLink software <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack>`_
page.


.. note:: **For Linux Platform**: to allow the access to serial ports the user needs read/write access to the serial device file. Adding the user to the group, that owns this file, gives the required read/write access:

           * **Ubuntu** distribution --> dialout group
           * **Arch Linux** distribution --> uucp group


Once connected on a USB port, if drivers have been correctly installed, the
XMC4700 device is recognized by Zerynth Studio. The next steps are:

* **Select** the XMC4700 on the **Device Management Toolbar** (disambiguate if necessary);
* **Register** the device by clicking the "Z" button from the Zerynth Studio;
* **Create** a Virtual Machine for the device by clicking the "Z" button for the second time;
* **Virtualize** the device by clicking the "Z" button for the third time.

.. note:: No user intervention on the device is required for registration and virtualization process

After virtualization, the DevKitC is ready to be programmed and the Zerynth scripts **uploaded**. Just **Select** the virtualized device from the "Device Management Toolbar" and **click** the dedicated "upload" button of Zerynth Studio.


.. note:: No user intervention on the device is required for the uplink process.
